# Global Alert Feed 🚨

A full-stack simulation of a global alert monitoring app. Built with React (Vite) on the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API on the backend, this project demonstrates distributed thinking, object-oriented programming, and CI/CD integration.

> 🚧 This project is a work in progress — built as part of my journey in learning JavaScript and .NET frameworks.

## 🔧 Features
- 🔄 Live feed of simulated global alerts
- 🌍 Filter alerts by region or severity
- 🧱 Frontend built with React + Tailwind
- ⚙️ Backend API powered by ASP.NET Core
- 🧪 GitHub Actions CI pipeline for testing + deployment

## 📦 Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
