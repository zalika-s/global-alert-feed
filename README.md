# Global Alert Feed 🚨 ✈️

A full-stack simulation of an airline operations alert monitoring system. Built with **React** (Vite) on the frontend and **ASP.NET Core Web API** on the backend, this project demonstrates distributed thinking, object-oriented programming, and CI/CD integration in a real-world aviation context.

> 🚧 This project is a work in progress — built as part of my application for the 2025–2026 Graduate Software Engineer roles in New Zealand, particularly with a long-term focus on airline technology.

## 🛫 Aviation-Driven Concept
Inspired by my interest in aviation systems and airline operations, this alert system mimics how airline ops teams might monitor global disruptions—ranging from airport delays to IT outages. The feed displays alerts by severity, airport zone, and event category.

## 🔧 Features
- 🔄 Live feed of simulated airline-related alerts
- 🛬 Filter alerts by airport region or severity (e.g., Ground Delay, Weather Disruption)
- 🧱 Frontend built with React + Tailwind
- ⚙️ Backend API powered by ASP.NET Core
- 🧪 GitHub Actions CI pipeline for testing + deployment

## 📦 Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)
- xUnit for backend tests
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Vercel (frontend hosting)
- Render (backend hosting)
